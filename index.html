        <p class="content">
            Politwoops is a digital archive hosted by ProPublica which publishes deleted tweets from public political officials or individuals campaigning to hold public office, 
            while the accompanying dataset, in the form of a downloadable CSV file, offers further information on the owners of the accounts themselves such as political party, 
            Twitter ID, and official government title. The tweets are collected using the Twitter API; Politwoops has its own Twitter account through which it follows officials 
            and collects their tweets, taking note of which ones are subsequently deleted. The information in the CSV file is updated according to the needs of the archive; 
            individuals who are no longer public figures and no longer tracked by the organization are removed from the file, while others are added when needed. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            There are many possibilities for reuse of the data, though this reuse is contingent on legal and technical constraints imposed by Twitter. As the individuals whose 
            tweets are contained in the archive are public figures holding public office, their deleted tweets and the attending metadata could be of interest to individuals such as academic researchers, 
            journalists, legal professionals, teachers, and those who wish to reproduce the archive for different sectors or different regions.

        <h2 id="methods">3. Methods</h2>

        <p class="content">
            The Politwoops dataset was and is created using an open source python-based tool called twarc (Open State, 2019) which interacts with the twitter API to store information about tweets. 
            When downloaded, the data offered by Politwoops is stored in a CSV that stores a Twitter ID rather for each politician as well as some additional data, including information about the 
            politicians’ official title, gender, and candidate ID, if available. Politwoops uses this list of Twitter IDs to use twarc to capture tweets for those accounts and check the Twitter API 
            for any that have been deleted. If they have been deleted, they host the deleted tweets on their website and display the time since deletion.
        </p>

        <h2 id="reuse">4. Reuse Potential and Significant Properties</h2>

        <p class="subheading">Potential Reuse</p>

        <p class="content">
            This particular dataset and digital archive is ripe for reuse, and there exist several possible communities or individuals who could be interested in utilizing the gathered information. 
            Researchers or scholars in fields such as political science, communication, or media studies could reuse the data in order to study the rhetoric of the tweets themselves, the role of 
            social media in the political field more broadly, or studying one or more of the individuals included in the dataset. In this instance, the researchers would most likely  need continued 
            access to the content of the tweets themselves, but in many cases would also need the information held in the CSV file regarding the owner of the account. In these cases, it’s likely that 
            the CSV file would have to be maintained and remain downloadable so researchers if researchers wished to perform an analysis of the individuals whose tweets are being tracked. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            It’s also possible that journalists could wish to use the data stored in this dataset; they would most likely need access to the content of the tweets and the metadata on the tweet itself 
            including but not limited to the amount of time the tweet was initially available, when it was tweeted and when it was deleted, though journalists may also require access to the detailed 
            information on the owner of the account which is available in the CSV file. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Other interested parties who wished to learn more about the context of the deleted tweets, such as interested private citizens or other politicians, could also make use of the dataset.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            The data, particularly pertaining to controversial tweets, could be used in the legal sector; if it were relevant to an ongoing court case or legal complaint, the reuse of the tweet’s content, as well as the metadata on its deletion would be pertinent. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Finally, The dataset and website could also be used as a teaching tool when it comes to curation of potentially problematic/constrained material and working around different terms of service/the limitations of services such as the Twitter API. 
            In this case, the source code itself would have to be preserved in order to be studied and discussed, as well as the metadata on the preserved tweets and account owners. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            The data held within the archive and the CSV file aren’t the only data points which have the potential to be reused by third parties, however. The code which Politwoops employs to collect the tweets is itself reused, 
            and thus could be of interest to others who wish to create and disseminate a similar dataset pertaining to a different sector of public figures or else political figures residing in a different region. 
        </p>

        <p class="subheading">Significant Properties</p>

        <p class="content">
            Politiwoops in the United States was originally owned and managed by the Sunlight Foundation through its Sunlight Labs. In 2016 Twitter banned Politiwoops from accessing its API. 
            This access was restored five months later, but Sunlight Labs announced its closure around the same time. ProPublica, instead, took ownership and responsibility for Politiwoops 
            and other major projects housed by the Sunlight Labs (Lomas, 2016).
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            One aspect of this dataset specific to Politwoops is that, legally, the tweets the dataset is known for cannot be archived offline and therefore are not downloadable. 
            As such only tracked politicians exist in a csv that can be downloaded. The archive of tweets itself is only accessible through the Politwoops  website. This is due to rules 
            set up by Twitter regarding privacy. The Twitter Developer Policy states that “If you store Twitter Content offline, you must keep it up to date with the current state of that 
            content on Twitter,” (Twitter, No Date). Because Politiwoops, by definition, deals with deleted tweets, all tweets on the site must be held exclusively online and cannot be downloaded for offline use. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Another significant aspect of the Politwoops  dataset is that politicians can opt out of being followed and included on the list of politicians tracked by Politwoops by emailing the company. 
            As such, this dataset and the tweets associated with it necessarily has gaps with regards to politicians’ deleted tweets. This aspect is also related to the Twitter Developer Guidelines which 
            allow for the distribution of users’ handles and information only if users “opt-in” to this use (Twitter, No Date).
        </p>

        <p class="subheading">Constraints</p>

        <p class="content">
            The most considerable constraint imposed on the collection and curation of the data included in this dataset is the use of the Twitter API. The API includes some 
            technical constraints regarding what and how much data the collectors are able to amass and the formats in which said data can be made available. Should Twitter change the 
            terms of services of the API, or else rescind the Developer’s Key then Politwoops would be unable to continue updating the dataset, something which has already happened before. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            The use of the Twitter API also imposes legal constraints when it comes to the format of the dataset and the reuse of the data itself. As it stands, 
            due to the terms of service of the API, the content of the tweets themselves cannot be made available or preserved in an offline format nor in any format 
            other than that in which they originally appeared; for this reason, the tweets are hosted in the digital archive and are not included within the downloadable 
            CSV file. Furthermore, identifying information about the account owners or authors of the tweets cannot be made available online unless such data is publicly available, 
            and it is noted within the Politwoops website that the additional information available within the CSV file such as the account owner’s political party affiliation, 
            federal campaign identification number, and official title is gathered from separate public data banks. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="threatassessment">5. Threat Assessment</h2>

        <p class="subheading">Curation to Date</p>

        <p class="content">
            The website that hosts the deleted tweets is well curated in that it provides the information that the curators want it to provide; however, from a metadata perspective, 
            the information about each object (tweet) is sparse or incomplete. Metadata includes the author of the tweet, a parenthetical indication of the author’s party affiliation 
            and state, the twitter handle of the author, how long it took for the tweet to be deleted, and when the tweet was deleted. In addition to this information, some objects have 
            additional information noting that Politwoops no longer follows the account associated with the author of the tweet and information about the original tweet if the deleted 
            tweet was retweeted. Because this information cannot be stored offline, it is at risk of being lost if the site went down. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Much of the metadata on the site is inadequate for users to create searches with that metadata. Searches appear to only look through information 
            in the body of the tweet rather than any of the metadata. For example, a search of “berniesanders” does not return all deleted tweets by Bernie Sanders, rather 
            any deleted tweet that contains the phrase “berniesanders” a majority of this tweets are from other accounts either responding to or talking about Bernie Sanders. 
            You can, however, click a link that allows you to see all politicians that are tracked and, from there, filter by user.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            The CSV file is, comparatively, a more robustly curated document. It contains the usernames, names, parties, branches of government, and other important metadata about each candidate. 
            This information is recorded with consistent naming conventions and follows many of the best practices outlined in the FAIR principles in that they are accessible and interoperable. 
            One key exception is that the CSV file only includes current politicians being tracked. As such, the dataset does not follow the principle that states “<span id="underline">metadata are accessible</span>, 
            even when the data are no longer available,” (FORCE11, No Date).
        </p>

        <p class="subheading">Threats to File Formats</p>

        <p class="content">
            Data in this dataset is stored in a CSV file, which is a versatile file format, but is also fairly limited. The Library of Congress notes that the CSV file format has 
            “numerous private specifications exist for various programs and systems, there is no single 'master' specification for this format.” Storing the data in a CSV file enables 
            the data to be reused in a number of programs without needing to depend on any proprietary programs. The CSV format is a very common way to transfer tabular data, and is not going 
            to go away any time soon, therefore CSV files are likely to retain widespread support with a variety of programs and platforms. This file format is very transparent, being readable 
            by humans and machine-processable. Self-documentation for the CSV format is poor, however. There is no way to represent metadata beyond header row indications, and the Library of 
            Congress recommends an associated codebook that describes the fields. (Loc.gov, 2021)
        </p>

        <p class="subheading">Recommendations for Further Curation</p>

        <p class="content">Based on our assessment of the Politwoops digital archive and attending dataset, the file formats are in the most stable formats available for long-term storage. 
            The dataset hosting the information about the account owners is hosted in a CSV file, one of the most stable files of its type. While the digital archive hosting the tweets is not as 
            stable as the CSV file, as far as we are aware there is not a better-suited file format available within the context of the constraints placed by the Twitter API’s terms of service. 
            It would be desirable to migrate the tweets to a more stable format, but as they must be hosted online and cannot be migrated to any offline format or displayed in a format different 
            from the one in which they first appeared, there are few options for migration.
        </p>

        <p class="content">We have the following recommendations for further curation of this dataset which we believe will enhance the preservation of the data as well as its discoverability and usability:</p>

        <p class="content">
            The current data is stored as a CSV file, but could additionally benefit from storage as an XML file in order to have multiple copies of the data and in various formats. 
            XML is designed to be both human-readable and readable by a computer, making it a valuable file format type for potential users to utilize for analysis. 
        </p>

        <p class="content">
            Another recommendation would be to include a CSV or downloadable file with the metadata associated with deleted tweets (though not the content of the tweets themselves) 
            such as when the tweet was posted, when it was deleted, and amount of time the tweet was live. Doing so would enhance the reusability of the dataset as it would result in 
            data which is both accessible and interoperable to a higher degree, “open, free, and and universally implementable,” and “broadly applicable” (FORCE11, No date). This would 
            allow for more researchers looking to conduct analysis using the data to easily access the data related to the tweet and use it in the same way they currently have access to 
            the data related to the account owner.
